                <p>Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit.'The Advancing Giant') is a
                    Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where
                    humanity is forced to live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from
                    gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to
                    exterminate the Titans after they bring about the destruction of his hometown and the death of
                    his mother. It was serialized in Kodansha's monthly magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from
                    September 2009 to April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34 tankōbon volumes. </p>
